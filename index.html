					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">

					<h1>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?<h1>
<p>- My Interest in IT started after I did an online coding course during year 12, in an attempt to expand my horizon in regards of hobbies and skills. In the coding course, I used the program Python in which I coded the program to browse and display COVID-19 statistics. In which the program displayed a Bar and Pie graph with cases, recoveries and deaths in India. Furthermore I also coded the pathways a fictional rocket would take to get to the moon and land. My overall interest towards IT is the sheer likelihood of success IT is likely to bring anyone with the understanding on the subject in the up coming future. As everything is foreseen to be heading in the direction of technological development, anyone with an advanced understanding on the topic is likely to be have job security and wealthy future.<p>


<h1>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?<h1>
<p>- Generally no-one was responsible for sparking my interest towards IT, however my mother  did influence me into viewing the prospects and capabilities that are associated with IT. I always possessed a good understanding of technology, which directly resulted in me being the IT person in my family. It was in fact my mum who in my ignorance, signed me up for the coding course after which my interest towards and decision to study IT began.<p>

<h1>Outline your IT experience (if any).<h1>
<p>- Online coding course, in which I coded Python to search and display COVID-19 statistics in major cities of India.<p>

<h1>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?<h1>
<p>- There were a lot of contributive factors in my decision to come to RMIT instead of Monash. However my end decision in favour of RMIT was finalised due to the 45 extra mins I would of had to travel for Monash by PTV. Coming to RMIT allows me to maintain equilibrium between my personal/social, work and uni life. Something I would not of been able to due to the 3 hr travel commitment. By choosing RMIT I am able to work 2 jobs comfortably while staying on top of school work and my social life.<p>
<h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?<h1>
 <p>- My expectations for learning during this course includes an advanced understanding in coding and programming as well as a sound understanding for basic software development and security. After which I aim to achieve a very high position of authority in a well recognised IT organisation such as Google or Microsoft.<p>

					<h2>Job Title</h2>
					<section>
							<img src="ideal job.png" alt="ideal job" />
						</div>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>My basic understanding of automation testing includes, the use of on external software seperate from the one being tested by entering test data and seeing how the test subject (software being tested) executes it. After which the results are compared to the actual results and then if needed, the software would be refined by myself and QA analysts with the help of software developers. This job is appealing to me due to the high salary it holds, as well as the job security. Through Automation Testing I will be able to implement problem solving skills that would ensure optimum results from the tested software. Thus resulting in an accurate and  efficient software. </p>
					<h3>Skills I have and need</h3>
					<p>The skills in this job require the applicant to have advanced understanding in coding softwares such as Java, React or Angular. Despite my ignorance towards these softwares, I plan on learning more softwares after perfecting Python to open more job opportunities. Furthermore, one would be praised on having knowledge on GitHub something I am currently learning and hopefully will be advanced in by the end of the course. In addition to this, an applicant is required to have experience in Software Development, Teaching integrated teams, as well as strategic development. All of which I plan on learning regardless of the time it will take. Personally I believe I have leadership qualities which will be of great use jobs that relate to this one. </p>
					<h3>Learning Plan</h3>
					<p>Upon completion of this course, I plan to do a masters in this which would further refine my skills and entail me using different softwares which will overall allow me to meet the requirements of using coding softwares. However, if I cover Java in the upcoming years of this course I will do a bachelors in software development which will allow me to understand the details of this job far more. </p>

				<article>
					<h2>What do the results of these tests mean for you? </h2>
					<p>Overall, these results show that I am an extroverted person who loves to communicate and work in team environments. Works perfectly for me as my end goal is to reach a high authoritative position in which I not only lead, but instruct and teach fellow coworkers, this is resembled well in my high assertive rating in the personality test. Furthermore, my tendencies to be a Tactile worker suggest me not to be someone for the desk. Thus eliminating positions in which I would be inactive, therefore a high authoritative position is shown to be the most accurate for me as there will be busy schedules in which I will indulge myself and produce better outcomes due to the heavy and busy work load.</p>
					<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </h3>
					<p>My extraverted personality suggests me to be an excellent asset in a team environment as by being such, I will be able to communicate and work better with a team. My confident and intuitive personality suggests me to work better in a team as I will have constant chats with teammates thus directly resulting in a constant trading of ideas which will ensure not only everyone feeling involved but a maximisation of ideas from everyone so the team can benefit from the best idea and refine other ideas produced. Me being an Auditory learner also highlights how by being in a team setting I will work best as there will be constant communication within the team which is suggested to work best for me.</p>
					<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team? </h3>
					<p>While forming a team around me I must gauge how extraverted and confident they are, to ensure maximum exchange of ideas and thoughts through discussions. My even split between ‘thinking’ and ‘feeling’ suggests that I tend to be both a logical and emotional thinker. Which represents to me that in a team, I would thrive as a leader due to the interpersonal skills a leader must have as well as problem solving and communication, all of which I am shown to possess. </p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>My project idea is an app called $ale$ in which the user is given the ability to find the sales that their favourite brands would be offering online or in store. Through which I aim to achieve an overall app that allows me to give users the convenience and efficiency of finding their favourite products regardless of the type of product. By doing so, this app will be a step up from the Honey browser extension as it allows users to search up an item they wish to buy after which the app shows them the item of their wish on sale, and the location of the sale online or in store, all the while Honey only offer coupons for online shopping Initial problems I anticipate to face are a good amount of downloads for my app at the start and a steady incline from there, furthermore the advanced skills that will be required by me to use the coding language Java and tools like MIT app inventor.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>This app would be in high demand as its an app that allows users to get their favourite products for a cheaper price then its normal price. This will do well in the app store as its a relatable thing for everyone. The app will consist of every product sold in shops, excluding houses, cars, manual labour etc. for one to see sales on. This is projected to do well as sales are something that attracts everyone due to the amount of money one saves. Furthermore, its more convenient for users as it allows them to have all the sales in one place, thus removing the effort of going to individual websites to find sales in stores. As imagined, every customer prefers to purchase items mostly while they are on sale, making it likely to be a point of success for my app. Furthermore, after trying to scour the app store and internet, I only came across Honey which was somewhat relevant to what I plan on making. However Honey, only allows coupons for online purchases and those purchases that it sees the user attempting to purchase, although there is a search function in honey for coupons, it is all online. My app will attempt to play on impulse buying and coerce the user to buying products that they were looking at but didn’t have intentions of buying in store and online. </p>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>I aim to do this through the layout and features of the app, the initial steps the user will have to take to use the app will include allowing ‘$ale$’ to see their location while using the app. After which they would enter their personal information like Name, Email, Phone Number. After this the user will be shown the mainframe of the app in which it will have 5 option to the app on the bottom layout. First option includes a vertical list of products that have been put on sale by shops all around their state, in condescending order of most recent to latest sales. This will feed the impulse buying likelihood, as this page will show all sales near the user spanned out across all types of products. The second option will be a search option in which the user can enter the specific product they aim to get on a sale. After which the app will dish out the item on sale, the location and the sale price. This allows the user to directly benefit from the app as they will be able to find the item of their choose in a affordable price. Third option is a self select in which there will be a list of what sort of item they want (technology, clothing, shoes, jewellery). After which they can pick the price they want to pay and the system will show a list of that category of item and in condescending order of the desired price from closest to furthest. The fourth option will be a location wheel in which, the user will have shopping malls highlighted around them and upon clicking one, the app will show all the sales happening in the shops of the shopping mall. Once the user has selected a shop, it will show them the items on sale and their sale price. This will save a lot of aimless scouring in a shopping mall by customers. The last and fifth option in the app will be a Wishlist in which the users are able to input their desired products. The Wishlist can be as broad as a category of an item or as specific as the exact brand of it. Users can add the product to their wish-list if the product they wished for wasn’t on sale, or the sale wasn’t big enough for them to want to buy it. When added to wish-list, $ale$ will send a notification for when the product has a sale on it or when the desired discount is on. </p>

					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>To make this app, I will be using Java and MIT app inventor in which I will code the program for the app through Java. Furthermore, I will need a laptop to code the program and a mouse as well as a keyboard which will allow me to write up the program for $ale$. I will also need to use SQL lite, to collate and examine all the data I would gain through users to further improve and refine $ale$.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>The skills that will be required by me to execute this app include an advanced understand of Java. As well as a good understanding on how to program the display of all the sales around the world and around the users. Furthermore, I will need a good understanding on the software SQL lite to sort out and show all the relevant data needed to improve $ale$ as an app. After which I will need to have thorough understanding in Automation Testing to ensure the longevity of my software and constant improvement to ensure the best execution of customer demands and display of sales. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The 2 original problems I am likely to face include the initial succession of the app in the beginning phase, as well as the programming skills I must have to make $ale$. When launching the app, I will do so in a period of time where there is a lot of online and in store sales. This gives $ale$ the relevance factor it can use to its advantage as it will be launched in a period of time where it can be used the most by customers. Thus helping solve the first problem as its likely to get downloads when people can use it the most, therefore increasing the chances of downloads. The second problem I will attempt to fix through thorough and constant practice of the softwares needed as well as steady updates on software improvement tactics for automation testing purposes and ensuring that I use the best and most responsive softwares for the development of my app. </p>
